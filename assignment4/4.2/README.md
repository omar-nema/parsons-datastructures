# Documentation - Assignment 4.2

The task in this assignment was to create a database + table, and insert sample data (related to the Alcoholics Anonymous dataset) into the table.

There are 3 relevant files:

- wa04a.js: In this file, the aaLocations table, which will house aaLocations data is created programatically.
- wa04b.js: This file takes care of the insertion - three rows of addresses are added to the database.
- wa04c.js: This file queries the table to ensure that the insertion was done properly.

In summation, these three files use the AWS API to create a table, insert data into the table, and then run a query to confirm that the results appear as expected.
